## Included Notebooks

### pandapower_init_and_internals.ipynb
This notebook provides an introduction to the `pandapower` library, including its initialization and internal workings. It is designed to help you understand the basics of power system modeling and analysis using `pandapower` in terms of accessing internal states and specify initial states. More detailed tutorial can be found via the [official website](https://www.pandapower.org/).

### pipeline_dnn.ipynb
This notebook demonstrates the implementation of a deep neural network (DNN) pipeline. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps. It is intended to guide you through the process of building and deploying a DNN model in the context of `pandapower` for your project.

## Data
This repository includes four base network and functionality to generate training networks based on parameterization of key parameters.

### Data structure
The data generation is handled by the `net_gen.py` script, which uses the definitions provided in `simple_net/transformer_high_pu.py`,  `simple_net/high_generation_injection.py` `complete_net/high_generation_segmented_grid.py` and `complete_net/transformer_high_pu_segmented_grid.py` to create networks with varying parameters.

nets = sample_net_high_gen_inj_xs(2)
nets[0].run_power_flow()
